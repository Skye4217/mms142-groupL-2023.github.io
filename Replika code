            <h4><strong>Replika - The AI that understands you</strong></h4>   
                  <p>Replika is an AI chatbot that utilizes textual context to procure personal conversations. The AI analyzes the text messages’ mannerisms, style, and topics to replicate how the person will write or talk to reply. Many say that the AI is like mirroring the person.
                  </p>
                  <p>Replika was founded by Eugenia Kuyda. Before Replika, Eugenia lost her dear friend in a car accident. After the friend’s death, she begins to forget how that friend speaks. In a desperate attempt to remember her friend, she fed an AI chatbot the text history of her friend. The AI was successful in understanding what kind of person her friend was and managed to talk like them. Whenever Kuyda talks to the AI, the AI will reply to how her friend would’ve replied. </p>
                  <p>She made the AI chatbot public which gained immense popularity. People were finding emotional and casual conversations with the chatbot. With the help of the co-founder of Luka, Philip, they built a build-your-own AI companion called Replika.

                  <p>You can customize Replika's avatar and earn points to buy more accessories and add personalities. They also offer the AI’s ”diary” to review past interactions.</p>
                  <p>Replika's main feature is making a safe space to converse with yourself. All the AI needs is the person’s conversation with it. After chatting with the bot for a while,  the AI can hold topics and words that the person wants to hear.
                           </p>
                  <p>Replika disturbs the therapeutic market because users were comfortable sharing their inner feelings with the bot. Replika is free and offers pro versions that have more in-depth and dynamic conversations, such as roleplaying and video calls, with advanced AI.
